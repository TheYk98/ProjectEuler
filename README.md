# ProjectEuler
Solution to Project Eulers
# 1. Multiples of 3 and 5
 This is really simple and anyone with basic math can solve. 
# 2.	Even Fibonacci numbers
Run through the fibonacci series check if that is even, add.
# 3. Largest prime factor
For any number, a factor can be repeated more than once like for example 100 -> 2*2*5*5 . whenever we find the factor we can reduce the given number 'n' times the factor repeats. (i.e) we can reduce finding the prime factor to 25 once we know that 2 is a factor

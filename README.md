# ProjectEuler
Solution to Project Eulers
# 1. Multiples of 3 and 5
 This is really simple and anyone with basic math can solve. 
# 2.	Even Fibonacci numbers
Run through the fibonacci series check if that is even, add.
# 3. Largest prime factor
For any number, a factor can be repeated more than once like for example 100 -> 2x2x5x5 . whenever we find the factor we can reduce the given number 'n' times the factor repeats. (i.e) we can reduce finding the prime factor to 25 once we know that 2 is a factor and the list goes on.
# 4. Largest palindrome product
Go through all the possible product combinations starting from 999 to 100 . Reverse the product and check if it's palindrome
# 5. Smallest multiple
Find the Least Common multiple for all the numbers in the range . (made use of Euclideans Algo for calculating gcd)
# 6. Sum square difference
```(a+b+c .......)^2 - (a^2+b^2+c^2.....) = 2(ab+bc+cd+ .....)```
Alternatively , Use the formula to find  ```sum of squares of n numbers``` and ```sum of n integes```
